# Stepper

Stepper is a step counting app for AsteroidOS smartwatches. It utilizes the motion sensor and other available sensors to accurately track the number of steps taken by the user.

## Features

- Accurate step counting using the motion sensor
- Integration with additional sensors such as gyroscope, heart rate monitor, and barometer (if available) to enhance step detection accuracy
- Customizable step threshold and inactivity time settings
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Error handling and logging for troubleshooting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An smartwatch running AsteroidOS with motion sensor. Stepper also supports smartwatches with gyroscopes, heart rate monitors, and barometers but are not essential
